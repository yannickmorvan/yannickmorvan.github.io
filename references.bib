  abstract = {Depuis leur apparition dans les ann\'ees1970 et1980 en Europe et aux \'Etats-Unis, les sciences de la complexit\'e ont suscit\'e un remarquable engouement \`a la fois scientifique, m\'ediatique et culturel. Certains des concepts qu'elles ont contribu\'e \`a rendre c\'el\`ebres, comme ceux de chaos, d'\'emergence ou de r\'eseau, sont utilis\'es dans plusieurs champs du savoir \textendash{} de la physique \`a l'informatique, des sciences cognitives aux sciences du climat. Les livres de vulgarisation \`a leur propos sont tr\`es nombreux et certains sont devenus des best-sellers. Pourtant, il existe peu de travaux en sciences humaines et sociales sur ce domaine \`a la fois tr\`es connu et peu compris. \`A partir d'analyses historiques, sociologiques et \'epist\'emologiques, cet ouvrage se propose de combler quelques lacunes. Le premier chapitre montre qu'il n'y a pas qu'une th\'eorie de la complexit\'e mais une pluralit\'e d'approches se revendiquant du m\^eme concept dont il est n\'eanmoins possible de d\'eterminer les contours. Le deuxi\`eme et troisi\`eme chapitres sont consacr\'es aux origines des sciences de la complexit\'e aux \'Etats-Unis et en France. Le quatri\`eme chapitre propose d'introduire le concept de plateforme scientifique de fa\c{c}on \`a saisir la sp\'ecificit\'e de ce domaine paradoxal: en effet, si ses fronti\`eres semblent ind\'efinies et souples, leur d\'enomination leur conf\`ere tout de m\^eme une identit\'e reconnue et claire. Enfin, poussant l'analyse un peu plus loin, le dernier chapitre d\'ecrit les pratiques \'epist\'emologiques et les visions ontologiques des praticiens de la complexit\'e, cela \`a partir de leurs propres points de vue. En raison de leur poids croissant dans le monde de la recherche et au-del\`a, il y a fort \`a parier que les sciences de la complexit\'e susciteront de plus en plus l'attention des sciences humaines et sociales \textendash{} ce \`a quoi ce livre invite},

  abstract = {Over the last decades, many specialists have worked tirelessly to improve the lives of people affected by mental health problems. Mental health has also received increased political and funding priority. Despite these global efforts, progress in understanding, predicting, and treating mental disorders remains disappointing. In this piece, I discuss two barriers for progress, and ways forward. The first barrier is mistaking mental disorders\textemdash complex, dynamic, biopsychosocial processes unfolding within people over time\textemdash for the diagnoses by which they are classified: clinically useful idealizations to facilitate treatment selection, planning, prognosis, and communication. The second barrier is reductionism, the isolated study of individual elements of mental disorders. Conceptualizing mental health problems as complex systems with inter-dependent hierarchies of biological, psychological, and social elements provides us with new lenses through which we can study mental illness. Similar to other fields like biology and ecology, a systems view also offers new levers, such as the identification of novel treatment targets or more optimal interventions. Embracing the complexity of mental disorders successfully will require opening our ivory towers to theories and methods from other fields with rich traditions, including network and systems sciences.},

Whether persistent~ crystalline order~can emerge~ in groups of autonomously developing multicellular organisms is currently unknown. Here we show that swimming starfish embryos spontaneously assemble into chiral crystals that span thousands of spinning organisms and persist for tens of hours. Combining experiments, theory and simulations, we demonstrate that the formation, dynamics and dissolution of these living crystals are controlled by the hydrodynamic properties and the natural development of embryos. Remarkably, living chiral crystals exhibit self-sustained chiral oscillations as well as various unconventional deformation response behaviours recently predicted for odd elastic materials5,6. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for how non-reciprocal interactions between autonomous multicellular components may facilitate non-equilibrium phases of chiral active matter.},

A central theme emerges from these contributions: if we are to make genuine progress in explaining, predicting, and treating mental illness, we must study the systems from which psychopathology emerges. As the articles in this collection make clear, the systems that give rise to psychopathology encompass a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions. The task of advancing our understanding of these systems will be a challenging one. Yet, this challenge presents a unique opportunity. From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems. This work provides clear guidance for psychiatric research, opportunities for collaboration, and a set of tools and concepts from which we can draw in our efforts to understand mental health, helping us move toward our ultimate aim of improving the prevention and treatment of psychopathology.},

Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain in creating the necessary bridges in understanding to allow researchers to apply NDS techniques and to enable practitioners to use the resulting evidence to improve patient care. This article aims to provide such a bridge. First, common concepts pertaining to self-organizing complex adaptive systems are outlined as a general approach to understanding resilience across biological, psychological, and social scales. Next, four data analytic techniques from NDS are compared and contrasted with respect to the information they may provide about some common processes underlying resilience. These techniques are: time-series analysis, state-space grids, catastrophe modeling, and network modeling. Implications for health scientists and practitioners are discussed.},

The positive manifold is often explained by positing a dominant latent variable, the g factor, associated with a single quantitative cognitive or biological process or capacity. In this article, a new explanation of the positive manifold based on a dynamical model is proposed, in which reciprocal causation or mutualism plays a central role. It is shown that the positive manifold emerges purely by positive beneficial interactions between cognitive processes during development. A single underlying g factor plays no role in the model. The model offers explanations of important findings in intelligence research, such as the hierarchical factor structure of intelligence, the low predictability of intelligence from early childhood performance, the integration/differentiation effect, the increase in heritability of g, and the Jensen effect, and is consistent with current explanations of the Flynn effect.

It remains an open question how to anticipate and study resilience, due to its dynamic and multifactorial nature. This paper presents a novel formalized simulation framework for studying resilience from a complex systems perspective. From this view, resilience is a property of a system that arises if a system is located in a stable and healthy state despite facing adversity. We use the network theory of psychopathology, which states that mental disorders are self-sustaining endpoints of direct symptom-symptom interactions organized in a network system. The internal structure of the network determines the most likely trajectory of symptom development. We introduce the resilience quadrant, which organizes the state of symptom networks on two domains: 1) healthy versus disordered, and 2) stable versus unstable. The quadrant captures different behaviors along those dimensions: resilient trajectories in the face of adversity, as well as persistent symptoms despite treatment interventions. Subsequently, we introduce a systematic methodology, using simulated perturbations, to determine where in the resilience quadrant an observed network is currently located. As such, we present a novel outlook on resilience by combining existing statistical symptom network models with simulation techniques.},

Though sum scoring is often contrasted with factor analysis as a competing method, we review how factor analysis and sum scoring both fall under the larger umbrella of latent variable models, with sum scoring being a constrained version of a factor analysis. Despite similarities, reporting of psychometric properties for sum scored or factor analyzed scales are quite different. Further, if researchers use factor analysis to validate a scale but subsequently sum score the scale, this employs a model that differs from validation model. By framing sum scoring within a latent variable framework, our goal is to raise awareness that (a) sum scoring requires rather strict constraints, (b) imposing these constraints requires the same type of justification as any other latent variable model, and (c) sum scoring corresponds to a statistical model and is not a model-free arithmetic calculation. We discuss how unjustified sum scoring can have adverse effects on validity, reliability, and qualitative classification from sum score cut-offs. We also discuss considerations for how to use scale scores in subsequent analyses and how these choices can alter conclusions. The general goal is to encourage researchers to more critically evaluate how they obtain, justify, and use multiple-item scale scores.},

In this view, responses to extraversion items correlate because they measure the same latent dimension. In this paper, we challenge this way of thinking and offer an alternative perspective on personality as a system of connected affective, cognitive and behavioural components. We hypothesize that these components do not hang together because they measure the same underlying dimension; they do so because they depend on one another directly for causal, homeostatic or logical reasons (e.g. if one does not like people and it is harder to enjoy parties). From this `network perspective', personality dimensions emerge out of the connectivity structure that exists between the various components of personality. After outlining the network theory, we illustrate how it applies to personality research in four domains: (i) the overall organization of personality components; (ii) the distinction between state and trait; (iii) the genetic architecture of personality; and (iv) the relation between personality and psychopathology.

At face value, Kane's theory would seem to imply that interpretations of phlogiston measurement were valid in the 18th century (because the evidence for them was strong), even though amounts of phlogiston do not exist and hence cannot be measured.

  abstract = {Network Analysis is considered as a new method that challenges Latent Variable models in inferring psychological attributes. With Network Analysis, psychological attributes are derived from a complex system of components without the need to call on any latent variables. But the ontological status of psychological attributes is not adequately defined with Network Analysis, because a psychological attribute is both a complex system and a property emerging from this complex system. The aim of this article is to reappraise the legitimacy of latent variable models by engaging in an ontological and epistemological discussion on psychological attributes. Psychological attributes relate to the mental equilibrium of individuals embedded in their social interactions, as robust attractors within complex dynamic processes with emergent properties, distinct from physical entities located in precise areas of the brain. Latent variables thus possess legitimacy, because the emergent properties can be conceptualized and analyzed on the sole basis of their manifestations, without exploring the upstream complex system. However, in opposition with the usual Latent Variable models, this article is in favor of the integration of a dynamic system of manifestations. Latent Variables models and Network Analysis thus appear as complementary approaches. New approaches combining Latent Network Models and Network Residuals are certainly a promising new way to infer psychological attributes, placing psychological attributes in an inter-subjective dynamic approach. Pragmatism-realism appears as the epistemological framework required if we are to use latent variables as representations of psychological attributes.},

  abstract = {Background Depression severity is assessed in numerous research disciplines, ranging from the social sciences to genetics, and used as a dependent variable, predictor, covariate, or to enroll participants. The routine practice is to assess depression severity with one particular depression scale, and draw conclusions about depression in general, relying on the assumption that scales are interchangeable measures of depression. The present paper investigates to which degree 7 common depression scales differ in their item content and generalizability. Methods A content analysis is carried out to determine symptom overlap among the 7 scales via the Jaccard index (0=no overlap, 1=full overlap). Per scale, rates of idiosyncratic symptoms, and rates of specific vs. compound symptoms, are computed. Results The 7 instruments encompass 52 disparate symptoms. Mean overlap among all scales is low (0.36), mean overlap of each scale with all others ranges from 0.27 to 0.40, overlap among individual scales from 0.26 to 0.61. Symptoms feature across a mean of 3 scales, 40\% of the symptoms appear in only a single scale, 12\% across all instruments. Scales differ regarding their rates of idiosyncratic symptoms (0\textendash 33\%) and compound symptoms (22\textendash 90\%). Limitations Future studies analyzing more and different scales will be required to obtain a better estimate of the number of depression symptoms; the present content analysis was carried out conservatively and likely underestimates heterogeneity across the 7 scales. Conclusion The substantial heterogeneity of the depressive syndrome and low overlap among scales may lead to research results idiosyncratic to particular scales used, posing a threat to the replicability and generalizability of depression research. Implications and future research opportunities are discussed.},

A wide variety of matrices that are used in statistics can be represented in this fashion, for example matrices that contain (implied) covariances, factor loadings, regression parameters and p values. qgraph can also be used as a psychometric tool, as it performs exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, using sem and lavaan; the output of these packages is automatically visualized in qgraph, which may aid the interpretation of results. In this article, we introduce qgraph by applying the package functions to data from the NEO-PI-R, a widely used personality questionnaire.},

  abstract = {Statistical models support medical research by facilitating individualized outcome prognostication conditional on independent variables or by estimating effects of risk factors adjusted for covariates. Theory of statistical models is well-established if the set of independent variables to consider is fixed and small. Hence, we can assume that effect estimates are unbiased and the usual methods for confidence interval estimation are valid. In routine work, however, it is not known a priori which covariates should be included in a model, and often we are confronted with the number of candidate variables in the range 10\textendash 30. This number is often too large to be considered in a statistical model. We provide an overview of various available variable selection methods that are based on significance or information criteria, penalized likelihood, the change-in-estimate criterion, background knowledge, or combinations thereof. These methods were usually developed in the context of a linear regression model and then transferred to more generalized linear models or models for censored survival data. Variable selection, in particular if used in explanatory modeling where effect estimates are of central interest, can compromise stability of a final model, unbiasedness of regression coefficients, and validity of p-values or confidence intervals. Therefore, we give pragmatic recommendations for the practicing statistician on application of variable selection methods in general (low-dimensional) modeling problems and on performing stability investigations and inference. We also propose some quantities based on resampling the entire variable selection process to be routinely reported by software packages offering automated variable selection algorithms.},

  abstract = {It is common to present multiple adjusted effect estimates from a single model in a single table. For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.},

  abstract = {Clinical sciences do not only aim to describe psychological disorders, but also aim to explain them. And we are currently witnessing revisions of theoretical, methodological, and epistemological approaches. For instance, the ongoing debate about the use of psychiatric classifications, such as the DSM and possible alternatives (Rdoc, HiTOP), illustrates the epistemological tension between categorical and dimensional conceptualization of mental disorders. However, both approaches face a common problem: finding a way to reduce, but not ignore the complexity of mental illness to meet the challenge of making meaningful progress in research, treatment, and clinical decision making Numerous theoretical models have been proposed and explored since the beginning of psychiatry, promising to increase our understanding of psychological disorders. A theory that has received a lot of attention in recent years is the network approach to psychopathology, arguing that mental illness is an emergent property that arises from causal interactions among symptoms (e.g. rumination {$>$} insomnia {$>$} fatigue {$>$} guilt). The last years have seen a growing number of statistical tools developed in the novel field of network psychometrics that have been used to study different aspects of psychopathology from the network perspective. The network approach encompasses \textbullet{} network theory, heavily inspired by long-standing theory in clinical psychology; \textbullet{} statistical models from complex dynamic systems theory that often have a long history in mathematics and physics, like the Ising Model. Recent developments in computational science enable to test network theory by embracing the full scope of biopsychosocial complexity. The network approach has gained momentum in part because it aligns with how clinicians think about mental illness\textemdash as causal networks of problems that influence each other\textemdash and promises to help clinicians understand the temporal dynamics of problems (e.g. symptoms) observed in clinical practice. While network models were originally applied mainly to cross-sectional data at the nomothetic (i.e. between-subjects) level, recent work has focused on studying within-person processes\textemdash including those of single individuals (i.e. idiographic)\textemdash and on formalizing clinical theories of mental disorders (e.g. panic disorder) and therapeutic tools (e.g. functional analysis).},

Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.},

We point out ten steps that we think will go a long way in improving personality science. The first five steps focus on fostering consensus regarding (1) research goals, (2) terminology, (3) measurement practices, (4) data handling, and (5) the current state of theory and evidence. The other five steps focus on improving the credibility of empirical research, through (6) formal modelling, (7) mandatory pre-registration for confirmatory claims, (8) replication as a routine practice, (9) planning for informative studies (e.g., in terms of statistical power), and (10) making data, analysis scripts, and materials openly available. The current, quantity-based incentive structure in academia clearly stands in the way of implementing many of these practices, resulting in a research literature with sometimes questionable utility and/or integrity. As a solution, we propose a more quality-based reward scheme that explicitly weights published research by its Good Science merits. Scientists need to be increasingly rewarded for doing good work, not just lots of work.},

For open research to become the norm, initiatives should engage academics from all career stages, particularly senior academics (namely senior lecturers, readers, professors) given their routine involvement in determining the quality of research. Senior academics, however, face unique challenges in implementing policy changes and supporting grassroots initiatives. Given that\textemdash like all researchers\textemdash senior academics are motivated by self-interest, this paper lays out three feasible steps that senior academics can take to improve the quality and productivity of their research, that also serve to engender open research.

  abstract = {Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest. Ownership involves socially recognized economic rights, first and foremost the exclusive control over that property, with the self-efficacy it affords. The inability to exert such control over crucial components of their scholarly infrastructure in the face of a generally recognized need for action for over three decades now, evinces the dramatic erosion of real ownership rights for the scholarly community over said infrastructure. Thus, this proposal is motivated not only by the now very urgent need to restore such ownership to the scholarly community, but also by the understanding that through their funding bodies, scholars may have an effective and proven avenue at their disposal to identify game-changing actions and to design a financial incentive structure for recipient institutions that can help realize the restoration of ownership, with the goal to implement open digital infrastructures that are as effective and as invisible as their non-digital counterparts.},

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be computed for many psychiatric disorders and phenotyping traits, including scores for resilience. We explored the correlations between several PRS and neurocognition in UHR individuals. We included 107 UHR individuals; 29.9\% of them converted to psychosis (UHR-C) while 57.0\% did not (UHR-NC) during the 1-year follow-up. Cognitive performances were assessed with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale estimating the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), the Trail Making Test, the verbal fluency, the Stroop test, and the Wisconsin card sorting test. Linear regression models were used to test their association with the PRS for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, ADHD, cross-disorders, cognitive performance, intelligence, education attainment, and resilience to schizophrenia. UHR-C had a lower IQ than UHR-NC. The PRS for schizophrenia negatively correlated with IQ, while the PRS for cognitive performance and for resilience positively correlated with IQ. PRS for schizophrenia showed a significant correlation with working memory and processing speed indices. PRS for schizophrenia showed a higher effect on IQ in UHR-NC, and UHR-NC with high PRS for schizophrenia had a similar IQ as UHR-C. Conversely, UHR-C with a high PRS for resilience performed as well as UHR-NC. Our findings suggest that cognitive deficits may predate the onset of psychosis. The genetic architecture of schizophrenia seems to impacts the cognition in UHR-NC. Cognition is also mediated by PRS for resilience.},

It attempts to point out the overlap, parallels, synergy, and possible conflicts between Open Science attitudes and practices, and contemporary views and practices in education. We aim to provoke a perspective~on the different aspects of how Open Science relates to education and propose several concrete directions forward and possible corresponding interventions. After explaining why education from an Open Science perspective needs to be explored and strengthened, we differentiate four faces of open education: the Open Science mindset, Open Science skillset, open educational resources, and how these activities should be recognised and rewarded. We subsequently illuminate three possible paths on how to strengthen open education, ranging from content to form and system. We hope that this will spark a broader national and international conversation on the relationship between Open Science and education.},

Many students chose to leave the accommodation they occupied during the study period if they had the opportunity. Our paper explores the effects of the housing situation on students' academic success during this lockdown using two quantitative national surveys (one on students' living and studying conditions before the pandemic and the other on the situation during this lockdown to which 5994 students responded) and 33 semi-structured interviews conducted amongst students living in university halls of residence in the North of France. Our study confirms that in a period of lockdown, housing plays a pivotal and active role in influencing students' psychological distress, study success, and orientation.},

  abstract = {Peer review of research articles is a core part of our scholarly communication system. In spite of its importance, the status and purpose of peer review is often contested. What is its role in our modern digital research and communications infrastructure? Does it perform to the high standards with which it is generally regarded? Studies of peer review have shown that it is prone to bias and abuse in numerous dimensions, frequently unreliable, and can fail to detect even fraudulent research. With the advent of web technologies, we are now witnessing a phase of innovation and experimentation in our approaches to peer review. These developments prompted us to examine emerging models of peer review from a range of disciplines and venues, and to ask how they might address some of the issues with our current systems of peer review. We examine the functionality of a range of social Web platforms, and compare these with the traits underlying a viable peer review system: quality control, quantified performance metrics as engagement incentives, and certification and reputation. Ideally, any new systems will demonstrate that they out-perform and reduce the biases of existing models as much as possible. We conclude that there is considerable scope for new peer review initiatives to be developed, each with their own potential issues and advantages. We also propose a novel hybrid platform model that could, at least partially, resolve many of the socio-technical issues associated with peer review, and potentially disrupt the entire scholarly communication system. Success for any such development relies on reaching a critical threshold of research community engagement with both the process and the platform, and therefore cannot be achieved without a significant change of incentives in research environments.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

  abstract = {Stoic philosophy has multiple parallels with cognitive behavioural therapy interventions. In their ancient texts, the Roman Stoics present a set of theoretical principles and behavioural strategies that are directly relevant to the clinical care of patients with a wide range of neuropsychiatric conditions. Mindfulness is a key component of the `third wave' of modern psychotherapy that closely resembles the ancient Stoic practice of attention or `concentration on the present moment'. Stoic mindfulness draws attention to one of the main principles driving both Stoicism and modern psychotherapy: the assumption that cognitive activity (reasoning) mediates emotions and behaviours. This principle can be traced back to Epictetus' Enchiridion, where he recognises that `men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things'. It has been shown that cognitive behavioural therapies and mindfulness-based interventions directed at patients with neuropsychiatric disorders were originally developed as Stoic-inspired treatment interventions. Both Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck (the founders of rational emotive behaviour therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy, respectively) explicitly acknowledged the role of Stoicism as the philosophical precursor of their treatment approaches. The effective implementation of evidence-based guidelines would benefit from an increased awareness of the influence of the Stoic tradition of philosophical therapy on the treatment approaches currently in use in neuropsychiatry.},

Yet proponents of evidence-based practice (EBP) have routinely ignored the root causes of many clinical psychologists' reservations concerning the use of scientific evidence to inform clinical practice. As a consequence, much of the resistance to EBP persists, potentially widening the already large scientist\textendash practitioner gap. Following a review of survey data on psychologists' attitudes toward EBP, we examine six sources underpinning resistance toward EBP in clinical psychology and allied domains: (a) na\"ive realism, which can lead clinicians to conclude erroneously that client change is due to an intervention itself rather than to a host of competing explanations; (b) deep-seated misconceptions regarding human nature (e.g., mistaken beliefs regarding the causal primacy of early experiences) that can hinder the adoption of evidence-based treatments; (c) statistical misunderstandings regarding the application of group probabilities to individuals; (d) erroneous apportioning of the burden of proof on skeptics rather than proponents of untested therapies; (e) widespread mischaracterizations of what EBP entails; and (f) pragmatic, educational, and attitudinal obstacles, such as the discomfort of many practitioners with evaluating the increasingly technical psychotherapy outcome literature. We advance educational proposals for articulating the importance of EBP to the forthcoming generation of clinical practitioners and researchers, and constructive remedies for addressing clinical psychologists' objections to EBP.},

TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a growing chorus of researchers has argued that psychological theory is in a state of crisis: Theories are rarely developed in a way that indicates an accumulation of knowledge. Paul Meehl raised this very concern more than 40 years ago. Yet in the ensuing decades, little has improved. We aim to chart a better path forward for psychological theory by revisiting Meehl?s criticisms, his proposed solution, and the reasons his solution failed to meaningfully change the status of psychological theory. We argue that Meehl identified serious shortcomings in our evaluation of psychological theories and that his proposed solution would substantially strengthen theory testing. However, we also argue that Meehl failed to provide researchers with the tools necessary to construct the kinds of rigorous theories his approach required. To advance psychological theory, we must equip researchers with tools that allow them to better generate, evaluate, and develop their theories. We argue that formal theories provide this much-needed set of tools, equipping researchers with tools for thinking, evaluating explanation, enhancing measurement, informing theory development, and promoting the collaborative construction of psychological theories.},

In the past century, various formal explanations have been proposed, including the dominant g factor, the revived sampling theory, and the recent multiplier effect model and mutualism model. In this article, we propose a novel idiographic explanation. We formally conceptualize intelligence as evolving networks in which new facts and procedures are wired together during development. The static model, an extension of the Fortuin\textendash Kasteleyn model, provides a parsimonious explanation of the positive manifold and intelligence's hierarchical factor structure. We show how it can explain the Matthew effect across developmental stages. Finally, we introduce a method for studying growth dynamics. Our truly idiographic approach offers a new view on a century-old construct and ultimately allows the fields of human ability and human learning to coalesce.},

  abstract = {R\'esum\'e La sant\'e mentale repr\'esente un co\^ut \'elev\'e pour la soci\'et\'e pourtant la pr\'evention semble efficace et rentable. Toutefois plusieurs probl\`emes se posent concernant la mesure en sant\'e mentale et notamment de d\'efinir ce que l'on entend par pathologie. Il convient \'egalement de comprendre comment les mesures de ces concepts sont op\'erationnalis\'ees et comment les outils sont construits. Ainsi pour la d\'epression, il existe de nombreuses \'echelles diff\'erentes qui ne prennent pas en compte les m\^emes sympt\^omes et pour une m\^eme \'echelle le seuil et la p\'eriode de temps \'etudi\'es peuvent varier, ce qui a des cons\'equences sur les donn\'ees de pr\'evalence obtenues. Il est \'egalement important de s'interroger sur les hypoth\`eses et mod\`eles utilis\'es concernant les causes~des pathologies psychiques qui sous-tendent les outils et les recherches r\'ealis\'ees. Pour finir, les troubles mentaux, tels que d\'efinis actuellement, d\'ebutent majoritairement avant l'\^age de 24~ans pour trois quarts des personnes. Les \'etudiants, dont l'\^age est majoritairement compris en 18~et 25~ans, sont une population particuli\`erement \`a risque ce qui peut avoir des cons\'equences tr\`es importantes tant individuelles que sociales. Les cons\'equences du coronavirus et du confinement, en lui-m\^eme et en raison de ses cons\'equences \'economiques et sociales, pourraient avoir un impact d\'el\'et\`ere sur leur sant\'e mentale. Malheureusement, il existe encore peu de donn\'ees sur les \'etudiants fran\c{c}ais et les \'etudes existantes ne sont pas facilement comparables en raison de m\'ethodologies diff\'erentes. Tous ces \'el\'ements plaident pour la mise en place d'une politique d'\'evaluation de la sant\'e mentale des \'etudiants. Mental health represents a high cost for society, estimated at 109 billion euros per year in France, 80~\% of which are indirect costs. Mental diseases start before the age of 24 for 75~\% of patients. Students, whose age is predominantly between 18 and 25, are a particularly high-risk population and for whom mental illness can have very serious consequences. The Observatoire de la vie Etudiante surveys from 2016 found a 12 month prevalence of depression of 15~\% with suicidal thoughts in 8~\% of the students higher than what is observed in the French general population, respectively 10~\% and 5~\%. The confinement itself and its consequences both economic (unemployment, difficulty for young people to find a job\ldots ) and social (isolation) could have a very bad effect on their mental health. The survey made by a governmental organization (Sant\'e Publique France) revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety disorders at the start of confinement in the general population. This prevalence decreased during confinement but remained significantly higher than in 2017. Economic simulated data indicate that prevention in mental health could not only be effective but also profitable. In France, reimbursement by national health insurance of 12 sessions of psychologists for young people (between 11 to 21) is being tested in order to further and widely implement psychological prevention strategies rather than relying on already widely reimbursed pharmacological treatments. There are, however, several issues to discuss. First of all, is the need to define what psychopathology is considered to be. Then, it should be understood how measures of these concepts are created, how tools are constructed and how they operate in their environment. For depression, many different scales exist and even if the most used one are taken into account, they have very little content or symptoms in common. In addition, for the same scale, many different cut-offs exist to define whether a case should be considered as pathological or not, and so it is with the period of time studied being considered that may vary, both leading to consequences such as the differences observed in prevalence. Other biases should also be considered such as the age of the participants, the gender, the size of the sample, the response rate, the method of assessment and recruitment. Finally, it is necessary to question the assumptions and models used concerning the causes of psychic pathologies. Biological hypotheses on the origin of depression involve genetics and inflammation, but sociological and psychological factors must also be considered as well as the underlying complexity both in their nature and interactions at different structural levels of space and time. We should avoid drifting towards a biological or a sociological reductionism and move forward through complex systems approaches and models. With regard to student mental health in France, unfortunately, quality data are still lacking, and existing studies are difficult to compare as some may also have methodological issues. This article leads to the conclusion that there is a need for policies to assess student mental health at both local and national levels with a reflexional thinking on the tools and scales to use as measurements of these phenomena. This approach does not require being too assertive, but should have full transparency on the way the measures were designed and obtained. Measures are as much needed as are the needs for coordinated prevention and care in mental health.},

  abstract = {There is no doubt that psychology-along with many other scientific disciplines-is in the midst of a period of intense self-examination and self-improvement. These activities are not unusual for science; indeed, self-correction is said to be one of science's distinguishing features (Kuhn, 1970). However, the current period of self-examination is more extreme than usual, and in psychology in particular, self-scrutiny has reached a fever pitch. This is evidenced by the many articles in both the scientific literature and the media about psy-chology's replicability problem and about psychology's innovative approaches to self-improvement (e.g., Button et al., 2013; Munaf\`o et al., 2017; Spellman, 2015). Underlying these discussions are concerns about the credibility of scientific claims; replicability is but one indicator of credibility, and the current "crisis" goes far beyond concerns about replication failures. Moreover, crisis implies that we are at a loss for solutions, when in fact we have identified many ways to improve sci-ence's credibility (Nelson, Simmons, \& Simonsohn, 2018). Thus, I will refer to these current events-both the problems and the solutions-as the "credibility revolution" (Angrist \& Pischke, 2010). In this essay, I explore what the credibility revolution means for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychology. I begin by reviewing the most salient changes that have been brought about by the credibility revolution. Then, I review some common concerns about the implications of these changes for psychological science and consider each of these concerns in turn. I conclude that the changes brought about by the credibility revolution are likely to hamper the rate of individual researchers' productivity, could have a negative or positive effect on creativity depending on how the changes are implemented and what is meant by creativity, and are likely to increase the rate of scientific progress. Abstract The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the "replicability crisis") in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress-the most important shared goal of scientists-is likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one's subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer.},

  abstract = {Background Comorbidities in mental disorders are often understood by assuming a common cause. The network theory of mental disorders offers an alternative to this assumption by understanding comorbidities as mutually reinforced problems. In this study, we used network analysis to examine bridge symptoms between anxiety and depression in a large sample. Method Using data from a sample of patients diagnosed with both depression and an anxiety disorder before and after inpatient treatment (N = 5,614, mean age: 42.24, 63.59\% female, average treatment duration: 48.12 days), network models of depression and anxiety symptoms are estimated. Topology, the centrality of nodes, stability, and changes in network structure are analyzed. Symptoms that drive comorbidity are determined by bridge node analysis. As an alternative to network communities based on categorical diagnosis, we performed a community analysis and propose empirically derived symptom subsets. Results The obtained network models are highly stable. Sad mood and the inability to control worry are the most central. Psychomotor agitation or retardation is the strongest bridge node between anxiety and depression, followed by concentration problems and restlessness. Changes in appetite and suicidality were unique to depression. Community analysis revealed four symptom groups. Conclusion The estimated network structure of depression and anxiety symptoms proves to be highly accurate. Results indicate that some symptoms are considerably more influential than others and that only a small number of predominantly physical symptoms are strong candidates for explaining comorbidity. Future studies should include physiological measures in network models to provide a more accurate understanding.},

However, despite this widespread endorsement and support, open research is yet to be widely adopted, with early career researchers being the notable exception. For open research to become the norm, initiatives should engage academics from all career stages, particularly senior academics (namely senior lecturers, readers, professors) given their routine involvement in determining the quality of research. Senior academics, however, face unique challenges in implementing policy change and supporting grassroots initiatives. Given that - like all researchers - senior academics are in part motivated by self-interest, this paper lays out three feasible steps that senior academics can take to improve the quality and productivity of their research, that also serve to engender open research. These steps include a) change hiring criteria, b) change how scholarly outputs are credited, and c) change to funding and publishing with open research. The guidance we provide is accompanied by live, crowd-sourced material for further reading.},

The aim of this paper is to consider how the quality of research practices can be improved by a specific focus on publication practices. Currently, the responsibility for documenting quality research practices is primarily placed on authors. However, barriers to improved quality publication practices cut across all levels of the research community and require a broader approach that shares the burden for ensuring the production of high quality publications. We describe a framework that is intended to be ambitious and aspirational and encourage discussion and adoption of strategies to improve quality publication practices (QPPs). The framework cuts across multiple stakeholders and is designed to enhance (a) the quality of reporting; (b) adherence to protocols and guidelines; (c) timely accessibility of study materials and data. We discuss how QPPs might be improved by (a) funding bodies considering formally supporting QPPs; (b) research institutions encouraging a research culture that espouses quality research practices, and internally supporting QPP review processes and professional development in QPPs; (c) journals expanding editorial teams to include reviewers with design and statistical expertise, considering strategies to enhance QPP adherence during the peer review process, and committing to ongoing assessment and development of QPP training for peer reviewers; and (d) authors and peer reviewers integrating QPPs during the manuscript preparation/peer review process, engaging in ongoing QPP training, and committing to openness and transparency initiatives. We discuss the current state and potential next steps within each stage of the framework and provide information and resources to enhance QPPs. We hope that the suggestions offered here inspire research institutions, leaders and faculty to discuss, reflect on, and take action towards, integrating these, or other, QPPs into their research practice and workplace.},

  abstract = {This essay outlines the historical context in which the Feighner criteria emerged; reconstructs, as far as possible, the process by which the criteria were developed; and traces the influence the criteria had on subsequent developments in American psychiatry. In the 1950s, when American psychiatry under psychoanalytic dominance had little interest in psychiatric diagnosis, Edwin Gildea recruited to the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University faculty who advocated a medical model for psychiatry in which diagnosis had a central role. In 1967, at the urging of the then-resident John Feighner, a discussion group led by Eli Robins and including Sam Guze, George Winokur, Robert Woodruff, and Rod Mu\~noz began meeting with the initial goal of writing a review of prior key contributions to psychiatric diagnosis. In their meetings over the next year, the task soon shifted to the development of a set of new diagnostic criteria. For three diagnoses, major depression, antisocial personality disorder, and alcoholism, the authors could identify the original criteria from which this group worked and the rationale for many of the changes they introduced. Published in 1972, the Feighner criteria were soon widely cited and used in research, and they formed the basis for the development of the Research Diagnostic Criteria, which in turn were central to the development of DSM-III. The team that developed the Feighner criteria made three key contributions to psychiatry: the systematic use of operationalized diagnostic criteria; the reintroduction of an emphasis on illness course and outcome; and an emphasis on the need, whenever possible, to base diagnostic criteria on empirical evidence.},

Common problems that arise from violations of this assumption include model misspecification, biased model parameters, and inaccurate estimates of internal structure. These problems are not limited to latent variable models but also apply to network psychometrics. This paper proposes a novel network psychometric approach to detect locally dependent pairs of variables using network modeling and a graph theory measure called weighted topological overlap (wTO). Using simulation, this approach is compared to contemporary local dependence detection methods such as exploratory structural equation modeling with standardized expected parameter change and a recently developed approach using partial correlations and a resampling procedure. Different approaches to determine local dependence using statistical significance and cut-off values are also compared. Continuous, polytomous (5-point Likert scale), and dichotomous (binary) data were generated with skew across a variety of conditions. Our results indicate that cut-off values work better than significance approaches. Overall, the network psychometrics approaches using wTO with graphical least absolute shrinkage and selector operator with extended Bayesian information criterion and wTO with Bayesian Gaussian graphical model were the best performing local dependence detection methods overall.},

Reform initiatives emphasize the benefits of transparency and reproducibility-related research practices; however, adoption across the psychology literature is unknown. Estimating the prevalence of such practices will help to gauge the collective impact of reform initiatives, track progress over time, and calibrate future efforts. To this end, we manually examined a random sample of 250 psychology articles published between 2014 and 2017. Over half of the articles were publicly available (154/237, 65\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = [59\%, 71\%]); however, sharing of research materials (26/183; 14\%, 95\% CI = [10\%, 19\%]), study protocols (0/188; 0\%, 95\% CI = [0\%, 1\%]), raw data (4/188; 2\%, 95\% CI = [1\%, 4\%]), and analysis scripts (1/188; 1\%, 95\% CI = [0\%, 1\%]) was rare. Preregistration was also uncommon (5/188; 3\%, 95\% CI = [1\%, 5\%]). Many articles included a funding disclosure statement (142/228; 62\%, 95\% CI = [56\%, 69\%]), but conflict-of-interest statements were less common (88/228; 39\%, 95\% CI = [32\%, 45\%]). Replication studies were rare (10/188; 5\%, 95\% CI = [3\%, 8\%]), and few studies were included in systematic reviews (21/183; 11\%, 95\% CI = [8\%, 16\%]) or meta-analyses (12/183; 7\%, 95\% CI = [4\%, 10\%]). Overall, the results suggest that transparency and reproducibility-related research practices were far from routine. These findings establish baseline prevalence estimates against which future progress toward increasing the credibility and utility of psychology research can be compared.

Yet a theory of psychopathology grounded in the principles of complex adaptive systems is lacking. Here, we present such a theory based on the notion of dynamic patterns: patterns that are formed over time. We propose that psychopathology can be understood as a dynamic pattern that emerges from self-organized interactions between interdependent biopsychosocial processes in a complex adaptive system comprising a person in their environment. Psychopathology is emergent in the sense that it refers to the person-environment system as a whole and cannot be reduced to specific system parts. Psychopathology as a dynamic pattern is also self-organized, meaning that it arises solely from the interdependencies in the system: the interactions between countless biopsychosocial variables. All possible manifestations of psychopathology will correspond to a wide variety of dynamic patterns. Yet we propose that the development of these patterns over time can be described by general principles of pattern formation in complex adaptive systems. A discussion of implications for classification, intervention, and public health concludes the article. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Psychosocial constructs can only be assessed indirectly, and measures are typically formed by a combination of indicators that are thought to relate to the construct. Reflective and formative measurement models offer different conceptualizations of the relation between the indicators and what is sometimes conceived of as a univariate latent variable supposed to correspond in some way to the construct. I argue that the empirical implications of reflective and formative models will often be violated by data since the causally relevant constituents will generally be multivariate, not univariate. These empirical implications can be formally tested but factor analysis is not adequate to do so. I argue that formative models misconstrue the relation between the constructed measures and the underlying reality by which causal processes operate, but that reflective models misconstrue the nature of the underlying reality itself by typically presuming that the constituents of it that are causally efficacious are unidimensional. I discuss the ensuing problems arising from these misconstruals. I propose a causal interpretation of associations between constructed measures and various outcomes that is applicable to both reflective and formative models and is applicable even if the usual assumptions of these models are violated. I put forward an outline for a new model of the process of measure construction and discuss the practical implications of these observations and proposals for the provision of definitions, the selection of items, item-by-item analyses, the construction of measures, and the interpretation of the associations of these measures with subsequent outcomes.},

In this article, we proposed a theoretical framework formalized as a generic mathematical model capturing the heterogeneous individual evolutions of psychiatric symptoms. The first goal of this computational model based on differential equations is to illustrate the nonlinear dynamics of psychiatric symptoms. It offers an original approach to nonlinear dynamics to clinical psychiatrists.                                         Methods                                In this study, we propose a 3+1 dimensions model (                 x, y, z                 +                 f                 ) reproducing the clinical observations encountered in clinical psychiatry with: a variable modeling environmental noise (                 z                 ) on the patient's internal factors (                 y                 ) with its temporal specificities (                 f                 ) and symptomatology (                 x                 ). This toy-model is able to integrate empirical or simulated data from the influence of perceived environmental over time, their potential importance on the internal and subjective patient-specific elements, and their interaction with the apparent intensity of symptoms.                                                        Results               Constrained by clinical observation of case formulations, the dynamics of psychiatric symptoms is studied through four main psychiatric conditions were modeled: i) a healthy situation, ii) a kind of psychiatric disorder evolving following an outbreak (i.e., schizophrenia spectrum), iii) a kind of psychiatric disorder evolving by kindling and bursts (e.g., bipolar and related disorders); iv) and a kind of psychiatric disorder evolving due to its high susceptibility to the environment (e.g., spersistent complex bereavement disorder). Moreover, we simulate the action of treatments on different psychiatric conditions.                                         Discussion               We show that the challenges of dynamical systems allow to understand the interactions of psychiatric symptoms with environmental, descriptive, subjective or biological variables. Although this non-linear dynamical model has limitations (e.g., explanatory scope or discriminant validity), simulations provide at least five main interests for clinical psychiatry, such as a visualization of the potential different evolution of psychiatric disorders, formulation of clinical cases, information about attracting states and bifurcations, or the possibility of a nosological refinement of psychiatric models (e.g., staging and symptom network models).},

I discuss two barriers that have contributed to a problematic oversimplification of mental illness. The first is diagnostic literalism, mistaking mental health problems (complex within-person processes) for the diagnoses by which they are classified (clinically useful idealizations to facilitate treatment selection and prognosis). The second is reductionism, the isolated study of individual elements of mental disorders. I propose conceptualizing people?s mental health states as outcomes emerging from complex systems of biological, psychological, and social elements and show that this systems perspective explains many robust phenomena, including variability within diagnoses, comorbidity among diagnoses, and transdiagnostic risk factors. It helps us understand diagnoses and reductionism as useful epistemological tools for describing the world, rather than ontological convictions about how the world is. It provides new lenses through which to study mental illness (e.g., attractor states, phase transitions), and new levers to treat them (e.g., early warning signals, novel treatment targets). Embracing the complexity of mental health problems requires opening our ivory towers to theories and methods from other fields with rich traditions, including network and systems sciences.},

The proposed model of attractor landscapes can be used to understand human behaviour change on different levels, from individuals to dyads, groups and societies. We use the model as a tool to present neglected ideas in contemporary behaviour change science, such as hysteresis and nonlinearity. The model of attractor landscapes can deepen understanding of well-known features of behaviour change (research), including short-livedness of intervention effects, problematicity of focusing on behavioural initiation while neglecting behavioural maintenance, continuum and stage models of behaviour change understood within a single accommodating framework, and the concept of resilience. We also demonstrate potential methods of analysis and outline avenues for future research.},

Dans cette approche, les troubles mentaux ne sont plus conceptualis\'es comme \'etant des essences s'exprimant via l'expression d'un ensemble de sympt\^omes. Les troubles mentaux sont con\c{c}us comme un syst\`eme de sympt\^omes interconnect\'es au sein duquel les sympt\^omes sont la cause les uns des autres. Cette interaction entre les diff\'erents sympt\^omes donnerait lieu \`a une boucle de r\'etroaction qui conduit \`a l'installation et la maintenance de ces sympt\^omes/troubles. Par ailleurs, cette approche propose que les comorbidit\'es soient le r\'esultat d'interactions sympt\^ome-sympt\^ome qui d\'epassent la fronti\`ere du diagnostic et interagissent avec des sympt\^omes appartenant \`a d'autres troubles psychiatriques. Un nombre croissant d'\'etudes a appliqu\'e l'approche par r\'eseau afin d'\'elucider les interactions causales au sein des sympt\^omes constitutifs de la d\'epression, l'\'etat de stress post-traumatique, la schizophr\'enie, ou les troubles anxieux. L'objectif g\'en\'eral de cette revue est de sensibiliser les chercheurs et les cliniciens en psychiatrie et psychologie clinique \`a l'approche par r\'eseaux, appliqu\'ee \`a la psychopathologie. Pour ce faire, nous pr\'esentons les principaux concepts et principes de l'approche par r\'eseau et son application dans l'\'etat de stress post-traumatique. Nous discutons \'egalement les critiques faites r\'ecemment \`a cette approche et ses applications cliniques. In a break with categorical and dimensional approaches and thus the classical medical model, the network approach applied to psychopathology constitutes a holistic approach to mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders are conceived as an interconnected system of symptoms in which symptoms are the cause of each other. It is suggested that the interaction between the different symptoms would result in a feedback loop that leads to the installation and maintenance of these symptoms/disorders. In addition, this approach proposes that co-morbidities are the result of symptom-symptom interactions that cross the diagnostic boundary and interact with symptoms from other psychiatric disorders. A growing number of studies have applied the network approach to elucidate causal interactions within the symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, or anxiety disorders. The overall objective of this review is to raise awareness among researchers and clinicians in psychiatry and clinical psychology of the network approach applied to psychopathology. To do this, we present the main concepts and principles of the network approach and its application in post-traumatic stress disorder. We also discuss recent criticisms of this approach and its clinical applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

Yet a radically different approach to conceptualizing psychopathology promises to advance our understanding, thereby complementing traditional laboratory experiments. In contrast to viewing symptoms as reflective of underlying, latent categories or dimensions, network analysis conceptualizes symptoms as constitutive of mental disorders, not reflective of them. Disorders emerge from the causal interactions among symptoms themselves, and intervening on central symptoms in disorder networks promises to foster rapid recovery. One purpose of this article is to contrast network analysis with traditional approaches, and consider its strengths and limitations. A second purpose is to review novel computational methods that may enable researchers to discern the causal structure of disorders (e.g., Bayesian networks). I close by sketching exciting new developments in methods that have direct implications for treatment.},

In this framework, psychological variables are understood to directly affect each other rather than being caused by an unobserved latent entity. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to estimating the most popular network model for psychological data: the partial correlation network. We describe how regularization techniques can be used to efficiently estimate a parsimonious and interpretable network structure in psychological data. We show how to perform these analyses in R and demonstrate the method in an empirical example on post-traumatic stress disorder data. In addition, we discuss the effect of the hyperparameter that needs to be manually set by the researcher, how to handle non-normal data, how to determine the required sample size for a network analysis, and provide a checklist with potential solutions for problems that can arise when estimating regularized partial correlation networks.},

Any solution needs to not only resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the governance of the scholarly community. It needs to replace the monopolies connected to journals with a genuine, functioning and well-regulated market. In this new market, substitutable service providers compete and innovate according to the conditions of the scholarly community, avoiding sustained vendor lock-in. Therefore, a standards body needs to form under the governance of the scholarly community to allow the development of open scholarly infrastructures servicing the entire research workflow. We propose a redirection of money from legacy publishers to the new network by funding bodies broadening their minimal infrastructure requirements at recipient institutions to include modern infrastructure components replacing and complementing journal functionalities. Such updated eligibility criteria by funding agencies would help realign the financial incentives for recipient institutions with public and scholarly interest.},

  abstract = {Biology differs fundamentally from the physics that underlies it. This paper1 proposes that the essential difference is that while physics at its fundamental level is Hamiltonian, in biology, once life has come into existence, causation of a contextual branching nature occurs at every level of the hierarchy of emergence at each time. The key feature allowing this to happen is the way biomolecules such as voltage-gated ion channels can act to enable branching logic to arise from the underlying physics, despite that physics per se being of a deterministic nature. Much randomness occurs at the molecular level, which enables higher level functions to select lower level outcomes according to higher level needs. Intelligent causation occurs when organisms engage in deduction, enabling prediction and planning. This is possible because ion channels enable action potentials to propagate in axons. The further key feature is that such branching biological behavior acts down to cause the underlying physical interactions to also exhibit a contextual branching behavior.},

  abstract = {The ``at risk mental state'' for psychosis approach has been a catalytic, highly productive research paradigm over the last 25 years. In this paper we review that paradigm and summarize its key lessons, which include the valence of this phenotype for future psychosis outcomes, but also for comorbid, persistent or incident non-psychotic disorders; and the evidence that onset of psychotic disorder can at least be delayed in ultra high risk (UHR) patients, and that some full-threshold psychotic disorder may emerge from risk states not captured by UHR criteria. The paradigm has also illuminated risk factors and mechanisms involved in psychosis onset. However, findings from this and related paradigms indicate the need to develop new identification and diagnostic strategies. These findings include the high prevalence and impact of mental disorders in young people, the limitations of current diagnostic systems and risk identification approaches, the diffuse and unstable symptom patterns in early stages, and their pluripotent, transdiagnostic trajectories. The approach we have recently adopted has been guided by the clinical staging model and adapts the original ``at risk mental state'' approach to encompass a broader range of inputs and output target syndromes. This approach is supported by a number of novel modelling and prediction strategies that acknowledge and reflect the dynamic nature of psychopathology, such as dynamical systems theory, network theory, and joint modelling. Importantly, a broader transdiagnostic approach and enhancing specific prediction (profiling or increasing precision) can be achieved concurrently. A holistic strategy can be developed that applies these new prediction approaches, as well as machine learning and iterative probabilistic multimodal models, to a blend of subjective psychological data, physical disturbances (e.g., EEG measures) and biomarkers (e.g., neuroinflammation, neural network abnormalities) acquired through fine-grained sequential or longitudinal assessments. This strategy could ultimately enhance our understanding and ability to predict the onset, early course and evolution of mental ill health, further opening pathways for preventive interventions.},

However, the literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N = 204 (N = 32 imaging) on two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N = 176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {$\Omega$}nyx).},

In this paper, we provide a treatment of how PMRFs such as the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) work as causal discovery tools, using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) as causal models. We describe the key assumptions needed for causal discovery and show the equivalence class of causal models that networks identify from data.

  abstract = {The network approach to psychopathology is a theoretical framework in which mental disorders are viewed as arising from direct causal interactions between symptoms. To investigate such networks, researchers typically estimate undirected network models from empirical data, called Pairwise Markov Random Fields (PMRFs), or for normally distributed variables, Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs). In this paper, we critically evaluate the use of PMRF-based methods to generate causal hypotheses about an underlying directed causal structure. We argue that hypothesis generation is critically dependent on the specification of a target causal structure: This is generally absent from applications of PMRFs, researchers instead taking a causally-agnostic approach. We show that the agnostic approach is fundamentally problematic, since the heuristics typically used for hypothesis generation do not hold for all types of causal structure. We illustrate the difficulty of hypothesis generation in practice even under ideal conditions, that is, when a (weighted) Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is taken to be the target structure. Difficulties arise due to the one-to-many mapping from PMRF to causal structure: Many different DAGs can result in the same PMRF, and these differ in their substantive interpretations. We demonstrate this by re-analysing an empirical GGM analysis, aided by a novel tool (available for download as an R package) which allows us to map a given GGM onto an equivalence set of linear path models. We discuss additional barriers to discovering causal relationships in practice, possible alternative formalisms for causal structure, and ways forward for the field.},

Whereas latent variable approaches introduce unobserved common causes to explain the relations among observed variables, network approaches posit direct causal relations between observed variables. While these approaches lead to radically different understandings of the psychological constructs of interest, recent articles have established mathematical equivalences that hold between network models and latent variable models. We argue that the fact that for any model from one class there is an equivalent model from the other class does not mean that both models are equally plausible accounts of the data-generating mechanism. In many cases the constraints that are meaningful in one framework translate to constraints in the equivalent model that lack a clear interpretation in the other framework. Finally, we discuss three diverging predictions for the relation between zero-order correlations and partial correlations implied by sparse network models and unidimensional factor models. We propose a test procedure that compares the likelihoods of these models in light of these diverging implications. We use an empirical example to illustrate our argument.},

Although psychologists discussed problems of theory in their discipline for a long time, weak theories are still widespread in most subfields. One possible reason for this is that psychologists lack the tools to systematically assess the quality of their theories. Thagard (1989) developed a computational model for formal theory evaluation based on the concept of explanatory coherence. However, there are possible improvements to Thagard's (1989) model and it is not available in software that psychologists typically use. Therefore, we developed a new implementation of explanatory coherence based on the Ising model. We demonstrate the capabilities of this new Ising model of Explanatory Coherence (IMEC) on several examples from psychology and other sciences. In addition, we implemented it in the R-package IMEC to assist scientists in evaluating the quality of their theories in practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved).},

Although models for binary data are infamous for their computational intractability, we present a computationally efficient model for estimating network structures. The approach, which is based on Ising models as used in physics, combines logistic regression with model selection based on a Goodness-of-Fit measure to identify relevant relationships between variables that define connections in a network. A validation study shows that this method succeeds in revealing the most relevant features of a network for realistic sample sizes. We apply our proposed method to estimate the network of depression and anxiety symptoms from symptom scores of 1108 subjects. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.},

It has been first introduced as a theoretical model for the alignment between positive (1) and negative (-1) atom spins. In many psychological applications, however, the Ising model is defined on the domain 0, 1 instead of the classical domain -1,1. While it is possible to transform the parameters of the Ising model in one domain to obtain a statistically equivalent model in the other domain, the parameters in the two versions of the Ising model lend themselves to different interpretations and imply different dynamics, when studying the Ising model as a dynamical system. In this tutorial paper, we provide an accessible discussion of the interpretation of threshold and interaction parameters in the two domains and show how the dynamics of the Ising model depends on the choice of domain. Finally, we provide a transformation that allows one to transform the parameters in an Ising model in one domain into a statistically equivalent Ising model in the other domain.},

Such high-dimensional model estimation, however, is not trivial, and algorithms tend to perform differently in different settings. In addition, psychological research poses unique challenges, including placing a strong focus on weak edges (e.g., bridge edges), handling data measured on ordered scales, and relatively limited sample sizes. As a result, there is currently no consensus regarding which estimation procedure performs best in which setting. In this large-scale simulation study, we aimed to overcome this gap in the literature by comparing the performance of several estimation algorithms suitable for Gaussian and skewed ordered categorical data across a multitude of settings, as to arrive at concrete guidelines from applied researchers. In total, we investigated 60 different metrics across 564,000 simulated data sets. We summarized our findings through a platform that allows for manually exploring simulation results. Overall, we found that an exchange between discovery (e.g., sensitivity, edge weight correlation) and caution (e.g., specificity, precision) should always be expected, and achieving both-which is a requirement for perfect replicability-is difficult. Further, we identified that the estimation method is best chosen in light of each research question and have highlighted, alongside desirable asymptotic properties and low sample size discovery, results according to most common research questions in the field.

  abstract = {Multivariate analysis using graphical models is rapidly gaining ground in psychology. In particular, Markov Random Field (MRF) graphical models have become popular because their graph structure reflects the conditional associations between psychological variables. Despite the fact that most psychological variables are assessed on an ordinal scale, the analysis of MRFs for ordinal variables has received little attention in the psychometric literature. To fill this gap, we present an MRF for ordinal data that so far has not been considered in network psychometrics. We present statistical methodology to test the structure of the proposed MRF, which requires us to determine the plausibility of the opposing hypotheses of conditional dependence and independence. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach using the inclusion Bayes factor to quantify the (lack of) evidence for a given edge. We use a Bayesian variable selection approach to model the inclusion and exclusion of edges in the network, and Bayesian model averaging to compare network structures with and without the given edge. We provide an implementation in the new R package bgms, evaluate its performance in simulations, and illustrate it with empirical data.},

A key assumption of the GGM is that each pairwise interaction is independent of the values of all other variables. However, in psychological research, this is often implausible. In this article, we extend the GGM by allowing each pairwise interaction between two variables to be moderated by (a subset of) all other variables in the model, and thereby introduce a Moderated Network Model (MNM). We show how to construct MNMs and propose an {$\mathscr{l}$}1-regularized nodewise regression approach to estimate them. We provide performance results in a simulation study and show that MNMs outperform the split-sample based methods Network Comparison Test (NCT) and Fused Graphical Lasso (FGL) in detecting moderation effects.

Applications of such network approaches to various psychological constructs have recently moved from a descriptive stance, in which the goal is to estimate the network structure that pertains to a construct, to a more comparative stance, in which the goal is to compare network structures across populations. However, the statistical tools to do so are lacking. In this article, we present the network comparison test (NCT), which uses resampling-based permutation testing to compare network structures from two independent, cross-sectional data sets on invariance of (a) network structure, (b) edge (connection) strength, and (c) global strength. Performance of NCT is evaluated in simulations that show NCT to perform well in various circumstances for all three tests: The Type I error rate is close to the nominal significance level, and power proves sufficiently high if sample size and difference between networks are substantial. We illustrate NCT by comparing depression symptom networks of males and females. Possible extensions of NCT are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

The aim of this study was to show that the use of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) could yield accurate neuropsychological profiling and that an alternative approach such as a multiple-case study could be a more interesting way to isolate discrete cognitive processes in the early stage of illness.The studied population consisted of 198 adolescents and young adults (16-30 y.o.) referred to our outpatient clinic. After the CAARMS' interview, we defined 3 subgroups: UHR (N= 104), First Episode (FE; N= 30), and Help-Seekers (HS; N= 64) who were neither UHR nor psychotic. Intellectual functioning was assessed by the WAIS-III (9 subtests version) and 'heterogeneous' intellectual profiles were defined based on the existence of a 3-point difference in scoring at subtests constitutive of the same WAIS index.While UHR did not differ from FE or HS on WAIS' scores and sub-scores, the multiple-case study indicated a higher proportion of 'heterogeneous' profiles in the Verbal Comprehension Index in the UHR sample than in FE and HS (p= 0.04).The disease progression could heterogeneously impact on specific domains, in patterns depending on the stage of the illness. This approach exploring intra-subject WAIS performances might be more relevant than the use of global scores in detecting the subtle cognitive alteration of emerging psychosis. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Implicit in both was an assumption that dynamic processes underlay the emergence of personality within and across people, but available methods at the time precluded testing dynamic questions. In this chapter, we first track the how the history of both nomothetic idiographic perspectives impacted the study of personality structure and dynamics. Next, we review findings and unanswered contemporary questions regarding nomothetic and idiographic structure, processes, and dynamics. Finally, we conclude by arguing for an idiographic network approach to understanding personality based in dynamic systems theory. We provide both theoretical questions for future research, some of which were proposed by early personality theorists but progressed slowly due to a lack of adequate methods, as well as cutting-edge techniques for actually testing them. We believe these methods capable of moving the study of personality dynamics \textendash{} and personality more broadly -- forward.},

This repetition undermines what we can learn from studying individual diagnostic constructs because it can obscure both disorder- and symptom-specific signals. However, these lost opportunities are currently veiled because symptom repetition in the DSM-5 has not been quantified. This descriptive study mapped the repetition among the 1,419 symptoms described in 202 diagnoses of adult psychopathology in Section II of the DSM-5. Over a million possible symptom comparisons needed to be conducted, for which we used both qualitative content coding and natural language processing. In total, we identified 628 distinct symptoms: 397 symptoms (63.2\%) were unique to a single diagnosis, whereas 231 symptoms (36.8\%) repeated across multiple diagnoses a total of 1022 times (median 3 times per symptom; range 2-22). Some chapters had more repetition than others: For example, every symptom of every diagnosis in the Bipolar and Related Disorders chapter was repeated in other chapters, but there was no repetition for any symptoms of any diagnoses in the Elimination Disorders, Gender Dysphoria, or Paraphilic Disorders. The most frequently repeated symptoms included insomnia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability\textemdash listed in 22, 17, and 16 diagnoses, respectively. Notably, the top 15 most frequently repeating diagnostic criteria were dominated by symptoms of major depressive disorder.

Estimating statistical models where a subset of the data is selected based on a function of the analyzed variables introduces Berkson's bias, which presents a potential threat to the validity of findings in the clinical literature. The aim of the present paper is to investigate the effect of Berkson's bias on the performance of the two most commonly used psychological network models: the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) for continuous and ordinal data, and the Ising Model for binary data.MethodsIn two simulation studies, we test how well the two models recover a true network structure when estimation is based on a subset of the data typically seen in clinical studies. The network is based on a dataset of 2807 patients diagnosed with major depression, and nodes in the network are items from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The simulation studies test different scenarios by varying (1) sample size and (2) the cut-off value of the sum-score which governs the selection of participants.ResultsThe results of both studies indicate that higher cut-off values are associated with worse recovery of the network structure. As expected from the Berkson's bias literature, selection reduced recovery rates by inducing negative connections between the items.ConclusionOur findings provide evidence that Berkson's bias is a considerable and underappreciated problem in the clinical network literature. Furthermore, we discuss potential solutions to circumvent Berkson's bias and their pitfalls.},

This study aimed to (1) explore the intricate relationships between worry related to potential SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 perception, sociodemographic factors, and the perceived effectiveness of lockdown measures and (2) investigate if these relationships differ between cancer patients and individuals without a history of cancer (IWHC). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional quantitative study in France between December 1 and 14, 2020. Network analysis was employed on a sample of 1889 women, including 282 cancer patients and 1607 noncancer individuals. Results: Our findings indicate that CP were 20\% more likely to express worry than IWHC. Anxiety is embedded within a complex network involving sociodemographic, cognitive, and emotional factors. The emotional components related to COVID-19 perception were found to play a crucial role. The networks for both groups were observed to be identical. Conclusions: Our study underscores the heightened vulnerability of cancer patients to pandemic-induced anxiety, emphasizing the crucial role of emotional components related to COVID-19 perception. The observed similarities in the anxiety network between cancer patients and those without a history of cancer suggest that universal approaches might be effective across groups.},

  abstract = {Le terme de science ouverte rev\^et un caract\`ere \guillemotleft slogan\guillemotright{} et agr\`ege diff\'erents aspects. Si l'accessibilit\'e aux productions de la science (comme les r\'epertoires publics de d\'ep\^ot des publications tels que HAL ou de d\'ep\^ot de pre-print/pr\'e-publication comme PsyArXiv) peut occuper une place importante de la science ouverte, elle ne saurait la r\'esumer. En effet, on observe parfois une confusion voire une r\'eduction des pratiques de science ouverte \`a la simple mise \`a disposition sans barri\`ere d'acc\`es des manuscrits de recherche dans HAL ou PsyArXiv. Il est important de consid\'erer cinq autres \guillemotleft piliers\guillemotright{} (en plus de l'acc\`es aux publications) qui soutiennent la science ouverte. Il s'agit : 1) des donn\'ees ouvertes et des r\'esultats reproductibles ; 2) de l'ouverture des \'evaluations, des opinions et des critiques (exemple de l'Open Peer Review ou \guillemotleft\'evaluation ouverte par les pairs\guillemotright{} et des plateformes de post-publications comme PubPeer) ; 3) des politiques incitatives et de reconnaissances pour favoriser le changement (comme les initiatives de type DORA et de leurs cons\'equences sur les institutions et organismes de recherche) ; 4) des technologies qui facilitent l'adoption des pratiques de science ouverte (\`a l'aide d'outils tels que OSF et GitHub) ; 5) d'une plus grande implication de la soci\'et\'e dans la science et ses productions (\`a l'image du mouvement dit de la science participative ou du label \guillemotleft Science avec et pour la Soci\'et\'e\guillemotright ). Cette diversit\'e des \guillemotleft piliers\guillemotright{} qui soutiennent la science ouverte est justement ce qui permet \`a diff\'erents acteurs (des chercheurs aux professionnels de terrain jusqu'aux citoyens) d'investir ce champ avec des comp\'etences diverses et compl\'ementaires.},

  abstract = {Background Mental disorders are highly comorbid: people having one disorder are likely to have another as well. We explain empirical comorbidity patterns based on a network model of psychiatric symptoms, derived from an analysis of symptom overlap in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV). Principal Findings We show that a) half of the symptoms in the DSM-IV network are connected, b) the architecture of these connections conforms to a small world structure, featuring a high degree of clustering but a short average path length, and c) distances between disorders in this structure predict empirical comorbidity rates. Network simulations of Major Depressive Episode and Generalized Anxiety Disorder show that the model faithfully reproduces empirical population statistics for these disorders. Conclusions In the network model, mental disorders are inherently complex. This explains the limited successes of genetic, neuroscientific, and etiological approaches to unravel their causes. We outline a psychosystems approach to investigate the structure and dynamics of mental disorders.},
